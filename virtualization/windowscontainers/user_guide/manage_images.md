Container Images provide the deployment foundation for containers as well drive container system efficiency through image layer capabilities. A container images includes applications and application dependencies and is used to deployed to new containers. Container images can be transferred between container environments, stored in a public registry for public use, and stored in a private registry for organizational use. Container images are created in a layered structure such that multiple containers use a single instance of a common container image. Container images can be created, removed and stored in a container registry for later use.
