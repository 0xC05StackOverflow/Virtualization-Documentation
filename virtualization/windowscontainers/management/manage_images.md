# Container Images

Container Images provide the deployment foundation for containers as well drive container system efficiency through image layer capabilities. A container images includes applications and application dependencies and is used to deployed to new containers. Container images can be transferred between container environments, stored in a public registry for public use, and stored in a private registry for organizational use. Container images are created in a layered structure such that multiple containers use a single instance of a common container image. Container images can be created, removed and stored in a container registry for later use.

# Container Image Architecture

# Installing Base Images

Container OS Images for Windows Containers have been prepared by Microsoft and can be downloaded and installed using PowerShell OneGet.

Return a list of images from PowerShell OneGet package manager:
```powershell

Once the Container OS Images have been downloaded, they can be installed on the container host using the `Install-ContainerOSImage` command.

```powerhsell
PS C:\> Install-ContainerOSImage â€“WimPath 'C:\CBaseOsPkg_NanoServer\NanoServer_en-us.wim' -Force
```
