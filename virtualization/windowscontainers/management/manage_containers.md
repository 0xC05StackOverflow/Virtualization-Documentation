# Windows Server Container Management

**This is preliminary content and subject to change.** 

The container life cycle includes actions such as, starting, stopping, and removing containers. When performing these actions, you may also need retrieve a list of container images, manage container networking, and limit container resources. This document will detail basic container management tasks using Docker and will also link through to in-depth articles. 

## Managing containers

### Create a container

Use `docker run` to create a container with Docker.

```none
PS C:\> docker run -p 80:80 windowsservercoreiis
```

For more information on the Docker run command, see the [Docker run reference]( https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

### Stop a container

Use the `docker stop` command to stop a container with Docker.

```none
PS C:\> docker stop tender_panini

tender_panini
```

This example stops all running containers with Docker.

```none
PS C:\> docker stop $(docker ps -q)

### Remove container

To remove a container with Docker, use the `docker rm` command.

```none
PS C:\> docker rm prickly_pike

``` 

To remove all containers with Docker.

```none
