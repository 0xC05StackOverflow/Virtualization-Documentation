# Container Orchestration
Orchestration is a key component of developing for and with containers and nearly required for successfully running containers in production.  The orchestrator is responsible for understanding the relationship between one or more containers that operate as a service or application, the underlying container hosts and the other resources (storage, networking etcâ€¦) within the environment.  For those coming from the world of virtual machines you might think of orchestrator as being quite like tools such as System Center Virtual Machine Manager, VMware VCenter or OpenStack.
There are several orchestration options available to Windows Server Containers with even more already under development.  The choice of which orchestrator to use comes down to the environment you deploy in, the operational models you use and an element of personal choice.
