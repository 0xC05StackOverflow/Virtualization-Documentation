# Windows Containers Documentation

Windows containers provide operating system level virtualization that allow you to run multiple isolated applications on one container host. This container documentation includes pre-release information and is subject to change. The documentation has a left hand table of contents that can be used for document navigation. Note, the table of contents can be collapsed for a wider view of the documents.
