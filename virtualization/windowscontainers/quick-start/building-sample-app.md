# Build a Sample App

The exercise will walk through basic deployment and use of the Windows container feature on Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise (Anniversary Edition). Now, let's build a sample app. If you need to learn how to get up and running with containers in Windows 10, visit [Windows 10 Quick Start](./quick-start-windows-10.md).

This quick start is specific to Windows 10. Additional quick start documentation can be found in the table of contents on the left hand side of this page.
