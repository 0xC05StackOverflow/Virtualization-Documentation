#Docker: Interactive session in a Nano Server host

*Note: For info how to manage a nano server remotely, go [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt126167.aspx) and look for the section tittled “Using Windows PowerShell remoting.”*

When you are using a Nano Server as your container host, you may see this error when trying to start a container with Docker:

```powershell
docker : cannot enable tty mode on non tty input
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (cannot enable tty mode on non tty input:String) [], RemoteException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError 
```

This will happen if you try to start a container with an interactive session, using -it:
```powershell
Docker run -it <image> <command>
```
Or if you try to attach to a running container:
```powershell
Docker attach <container name>
```

This is because an interactive session cannot be started in the Nano Server host. You will have to do it remotely. Follow these steps to do so:

1.	You will need to have a copy of Docker in the machine you are using to remotely manage the Nano Server. To get a copy of the version of Docker used in TP4, go here. This link will download Docker. You can place Docker wherever you like.
2.	On your Nano Server, you will need to set up the docker daemon to listen to commands remotely. Run the command:
```powershell
Docker daemon -D -H <ip address of Nano Server>:2375
```
You should see a stream of red text after running the command.
 
3.	On the machine you are using to manage the Nano Server, open a PowerShell session a go to the directory where you have Docker.
4.	From here, you can now manage the docker daemon that is in your Nano Server. You will need to structure your commands like this:
```powershell
.\docker.exe -H tcp://<ip address of Nano Server>:2375
```
For example, if you would like to see the available images: 
```powershell
.\docker.exe -H tcp://<ip address of Nano Server>:2375 images
```
