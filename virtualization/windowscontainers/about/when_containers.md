title: When to use Containers


# When to use Containers #

There are a number of scenarios where containers could come in handy.  Some of these include:

- Deploying applications on a server without doing an explicit install
- Deploying an application on a server without having side effects on the server
- Applications that normally don't play well togheter (or coexist) can be run next to each other in seperate containers
- Allows running an application in a sandbox to limit what files it has access to
