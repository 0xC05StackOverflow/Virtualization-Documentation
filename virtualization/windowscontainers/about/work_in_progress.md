# Work in Progress

If you don't see your problem addressed here or have questions, post them on the [forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

-----------------------

## General functionality

### Windows Container Image must exactly match container host
A Windows Server Container requires an opertaing system image that matches the container host in respect to build and patch level. A mismatch will lead to instability and or unpredictable behavior for the container and/or the host.
<!-- Can we give examples of behavior or errors?  Makes it more searchable -->

** Work Around: **  
Download and install a container OS <!-- Container base image? --> matching the OS version and patch level of the container host.


### Commands sporadically fail -- try again
In our testing, commands occasionally need to be run multiple times.  The same principle applies to other actions.  
For example, if you create a new file and it doesn't appear, try touching the file.  

If you have to do this, let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

** Work Around:  **  
Build scripts such that they try commands multiple times.  If a command fails, try again.  

### All non-C:/ drives appear in the container
All non-C:/ drives available to the container host are also mapped into all running Windows Server Containers.  

Since there is no way to map folders into a container, this is a way to share data.

**Work Around: **  
We're working on it.  In the future there will be folder sharing.

--------------------------

## Networking

### Number of compartments per container
In this release we support one compartment per container. 

**Work Around: **  
If multiple endpoints exposed by the container are needed, use NAT port mapping.

--------------------------

## Application compatibility

### Can't install IIS in a container using DISM 
Installing IIS-ASPNET45 in a container doesn't work inside a Windows Server container.  The installation progress sticks around 95.5%.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-ASPNET45
```

This fails because ASP.NET 4.5 doesn't run in a container.

** Work Around: **  
ASP 5.0 does work.  Instead, install the Web-Server role.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Web-Server
```

### Remote access of containers
Windows Server Containers can be managed/interacted with through a RDP session. Exiting the container RDP session without logoff may prevent the container from shutting down.

** Work Around: **  
Exit the RDP session by typing "logoff" (instead of "exit" or just closing the RDP window) before shutting the container down.

## Docker management

### Docker clients unsecured by default
In this pre-release, docker communication is public if you know where to look.

To secure your windows server container to Docker communications, use this script: LARS?  STEVE?



### Docker commands that don't work with Windows Server Containers

Commands known to fail:

| **Docker command** | **Where it runs** | **Error** | **Notes** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **docker commit** | image | Docker stops running container and doesnâ€™t shows correct error message | We're working on it :) |
| **docker diff** | daemon | Error: The windows graphdriver does not support Changes() | |
| **docker kill** | container | Error: Invalid signal: KILL  Error: failed to kill containers:[] | |
| **docker load** | image | Fails silently | No error but the image isn't loading either |
| **docker pause** | container | Error: Windows container cannot be paused.  May be not supported | |
| **docker port** | container |  | No port is getting listed even we are able to RDP.
| **docker pull** | daemon | Error: System cannot find the file path. We cant run container using this image. | Image is getting added can't be used.  We're working on it :) |
| **docker restart** | container | Error: A system shutdown is in progress. |  |
| **docker unpause** | container |  | Can't test because pause doesn't work yet. |

If anything that isn't on this list fails (or if a command fails differently than expected), let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).



### Docker commands that partially work with Windows Server Containers

Commands with partial functionality:

| **Docker command** | **Runs on...** | **Parameter** | **Notes** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **docker attach** | container | --no-stdin=false | The command doesn't exit when Ctrl-P and CTRL-Q is pressed |
| | | --sig-proxy=true | works |
| **docker build** | images | -f, --file | Error: Unable to prepare context: Unable to get synlinks |
| | | --force-rm=false | works |
| | | --no-cache=false | works |
| | | -q, --quiet=false | |
| | | --rm=true | works|
| | | -t, --tag="" | works |
| **docker login** | daemon | -e, -p, -u | sporratic behavior | 
| **docker push** | daemon | | Getting occasional "repository does not exit" errors. |
| **docker rm** | container | -f | Error: A system shutdown is in progress. |

If anything that isn't on this list fails, if a command fails differently than expected, or if you find a work around, let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).


### Pasting commands to interactive Docker session is limited to 50 characters
If you copy a command line into an interactive Docker session, it is currently limited to 50 characters.

## Issues solved by Zero Day Patch
If you encounter error messages like this when creating a new container image using Docker, please apply the Zero Day Patch for Windows Server 2016 TP3. This can occur e.g. when running the Python-3.4.3.msi installer or node-v0.12.7.msi
```
hcsshim::ExportLayer - Win32 API call returned error r1=2147942523 err=The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. layerId=606a2c430fccd1091b9ad2f930bae009956856cf4e6c66062b188aac48aa2e34 flavour=1 folder=C:\ProgramData\docker\windowsfilter\606a2c430fccd1091b9ad2f930bae009956856cf4e6c66062b188aac48aa2e34-1868857733
