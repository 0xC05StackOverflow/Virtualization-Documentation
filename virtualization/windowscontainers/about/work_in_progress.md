# Work in Progress

If you don't see your problem addressed here or have questions, post them on the [forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

A more detailed explaination to identify the issue.

Description

** More Information: ** (optional)  
When does this happen?  Why?

-----------------------

## General functionality

### Run twice
In our testing, commands occasionally need to be run multiple times.  Sometimes you need to touch the file.
We're working on it :).  If you have top do this, let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

### Drive mapping
All non-C:/ drives mapped in the container host appear in all Windows Server Containers.  

Since there is no way to map folders into a container, this is a way to share data.

**Work Around: **
We're working on it.


## Application compatability

### Can't install IIS in a container using DISM 
Installing IIS-ASPNET45 in a container doesn't work inside a Windows Server container.  The installation progress sticks around 95.5%.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-ASPNET45
```

This fails because ASP.NET 4.5 doesn't run in a container.

** Work Around: **  
ASP 5.0 does work.  Instead, install the Web-Server role.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-WebServerRole
```

## Docker management

### Docker clients unsecured by default
In this pre-release, docker communication is public if you know where to look.

To secure your windows server container to Docker communications, use this script: LARS?  STEVE?
