# Work in Progress

If you don't see your problem addressed here or have questions, post them on the [forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

-----------------------

## General functionality

### Windows Container Image must exactly match container host
A Windows Server Container requires an opertaing system image that matches the container host in respect to build and patch level. A mismatch will lead to instability and or unpredictable behavior for the container and/or the host.
<!-- Can we give examples of behavior or errors?  Makes it more searchable -->

** Work Around: **  
Download and install a container OS <!-- Container base image? --> matching the OS version and patch level of the container host.


### Commands sporadically fail -- try again
In our testing, commands occasionally need to be run multiple times.  The same principle applies to other actions.  
For example, if you create a new file and it doesn't appear, try touching the file.  

If you have to do this, let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

** Work Around:  **  
Build scripts such that they try commands multiple times.  If a command fails, try again.  

### All non-C:/ drives appear in the container
All non-C:/ drives available to the container host are also mapped into all running Windows Server Containers.  

Since there is no way to map folders into a container, this is a way to share data.

**Work Around: **  
We're working on it.  In the future there will be folder sharing.

--------------------------

## Networking

### Number of compartments per container
In this release we support one compartment per container. 

**Work Around: **  
If multiple endpoints exposed by the container are needed, use NAT port mapping.

--------------------------

## Application compatibility

### Can't install ASP.NET 4.5 with IIS in a container using DISM 
Installing IIS-ASPNET45 in a container doesn't work inside a Windows Server container.  The installation progress sticks around 95.5%.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-ASPNET45
```

This fails because ASP.NET 4.5 doesn't run in a container.

** Work Around: **  
Instead, install the Web-Server role to use IIS. ASP 5.0 does work. 

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Web-Server
```

### Remote access of containers
Windows Server Containers can be managed/interacted with through a RDP session. Exiting the container RDP session without logoff may prevent the container from shutting down.

** Work Around: **  
Exit the RDP session by typing "logoff" (instead of "exit" or just closing the RDP window) before shutting the container down.

### Applications

The following applications have been tried to run in a Windows Server Container.
These results are no guarantee that a specific application is working or not working properly. The sole purpose is to share our experience when testing applications in a Container.

## Docker management

### Docker clients unsecured by default
In this pre-release, docker communication is public if you know where to look.


### Docker commands that don't work with Windows Server Containers

Commands known to fail:

| **Docker command** | **Where it runs** | **Error** | **Notes** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|

## Issues solved by Zero Day Patch
If you encounter error messages like this when creating a new container image using Docker, please apply the Zero Day Patch for Windows Server 2016 TP3. This can occur e.g. when running the Python-3.4.3.msi installer or node-v0.12.7.msi
```
