# Work in Progress

If you don't see your problem addressed here or have questions, post them on the [forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

**Template**  
## Broad category

### Specific issue
A more detailed explaination to identify the issue.

** Work Around: **  
Description

** More Information: ** (optional)  
When does this happen?  Why?

-----------------------

## General functionality

### Windows Container Image 
A Windows Server Container requires a opertaing system image that matches the container host in respect to build and patch level. A mismatch will lead to instability and or unpredictable behaivor for the container and/or the host.
We try to limit this impact by not starting containers with mismatched container OS. 

** Work Around: **  
Download and install a container OS matching the OS version and patch level of the container host.


### Run twice
In our testing, commands occasionally need to be run multiple times.  THe same principle applies to other actions.  For example, if you create a new file and it doesn't appear, try touching the file.  
We're working on it :).  If you have top do this, let us know via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

### Drive mapping
All non-C:/ drives mapped in the container (that represent a physical drive on the host) appear in all Windows Server Containers.  

Since there is no way to map folders into a container, this is a way to share data.

**Work Around: **
We're working on it.

## Networking

### Number of compartments per container
In this release we support one compartment per container. 

**Work Around: **
If multiple endpoints exposed by the container are needed, use NAT port mapping.


## Application compatability

### Can't install IIS in a container using DISM 
Installing IIS-ASPNET45 in a container doesn't work inside a Windows Server container.  The installation progress sticks around 95.5%.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-ASPNET45
```

This fails because ASP.NET 4.5 doesn't run in a container.

** Work Around: **  
ASP 5.0 does work.  Instead, install the Web-Server role.

``` PowerShell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Web-Server
```

### Remote access of containers
Windows Server Containers can be managed/interacted with through a RDP session. Exiting the container RDP session without logoff may prevent the container from shutting down.

** Work Around: **  
Exit the RDP session by typing "logoff" (instead of "exit" or just closing the RDP window) before shutting the container down.

## Docker management

### Docker clients unsecured by default
In this pre-release, docker communication is public if you know where to look.

To secure your windows server container to Docker communications, use this script: LARS?  STEVE?
