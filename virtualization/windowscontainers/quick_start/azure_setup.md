#Preparing Microsoft Azure for Windows Containers

Before creating and managing Windows Containers the Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview environment must be prepared. With this preview release, two hands on experiences are available, one running in an Azure and one running in your on-premises environment. This guide will walk through configuring Windows container in a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure. 

To setup Windows Containers on your own virtual machine or system see the following document – [Windows Containers On-premises](./container_setup.md).
