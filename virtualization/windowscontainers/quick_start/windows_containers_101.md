# Windows Containers on Windows Server

This exercise will walk through the basic deployment of the Windows container feature and Docker on Windows Server 2016. This exercise assumes that you have familiarized yourself with basic container concepts and terminology. If you need to review concepts and terminology, see the [Quick Start Introduction](./quick_start.md).

This exercise must be run on **Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5**. The Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 installation media can be found [here]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview).
If you would like to work through this exercise on Windows 10, see the [Windows 10 Container Quick Start](./windows_10_containers_101.md).


## 1. Install Container Feature

The container feature needs to be enabled before working with Windows containers. To do so run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session. 

```none
Install-WindowsFeature containers
```

## 2. Install Docker

Docker is required in order to work with Windows containers. Docker consists of the Docker Engine, or server components, and the Docker client. For this exercise, both will be installed. Run the following commands to do so. 

```none
# Create Docker directory
New-Item -Type Directory $env:programfiles\docker

# Download Docker Engine
Invoke-WebRequest https://master.dockerproject.org/windows/amd64/dockerd-1.12.0-dev.exe -OutFile $env:programfiles\docker\dockerd.exe

# Add Docker folder to the path
$env:Path += ";$env:programfiles\docker"

# Install Docker Engine as a Windows Service
dockerd --register-service
```

The following command will download the Docker client.

```none
# Download Docker Client
Invoke-WebRequest https://master.dockerproject.org/windows/amd64/docker.exe -OutFile $env:programfiles\docker\docker.exe
```

## 3. Install Base Container Images

Before a container can be deployed, a container base OS image needs to be downloaded. The following commands will download the Windows Server Core base OS image. This process can take some time, so teak a break and pick back up once the download has completed. 
    
```none
# Install Container Image Provider    
Install-PackageProvider ContainerImage -Force    

# Install Windows Server Core Image  
Install-ContainerImage -Name WindowsServerCore    
```

## 4. Verify Deployment

At this stage the Windows container feature and Docker are ready to deploy containers. To verify, open up a Windows command prompt and type `docker imagesâ€™, this will display the installed images.

```none
docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
windowsservercore   10.0.14300.1000     dbfee88ee9fd        7 weeks ago         9.344 GB
```

## 5. Deploy Your First Container
