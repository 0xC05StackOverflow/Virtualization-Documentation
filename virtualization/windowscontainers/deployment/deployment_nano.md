# Container host deployment - Nano Server

**This is preliminary content and subject to change.** 

Deploying a Windows container host has different steps depending on the operating system and the host system type (physical or virtual). The steps in this document are used to deploy a Windows Container host to Nano Server, on a physical or virtual system.

These steps need to be taken if Hyper-V containers will be used. Note, the steps marked with and * are only necessary if the container host will be virtualized.

## Deployment steps

### <a name=nano></a> Prepare Nano Server

Deploying Nano Server involves creating a prepared virtual hard drive, which includes the Nano Server operating system, and additional feature packages. This guide quickly details preparing a Nano Server virtual hard drive, which can be used for Windows containers. For more information on Nano Server, and to explore different Nano Server deployment options, see the [Nano Server documentation]( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt126167.aspx).

Create a folder named `nano`.

```none
New-Item -ItemType Directory c:\nano
```

Locate the `NanoServerImageGenerator.psm1` and `Convert-WindowsImage.ps1` files on the Windows Server Media. Copy these to `c:\nano`.

```none
# Set path to Windows Server 2016 Media

$WindowsMedia = "C:\TP5Media"

# Copy Files
	
Copy-Item $WindowsMedia\NanoServer\NanoServerImageGenerator\Convert-WindowsImage.ps1 c:\nano
Copy-Item $WindowsMedia\NanoServer\NanoServerImageGenerator\NanoServerImageGenerator.psm1 c:\nano
```
Run the following to create a Nano Server virtual hard drive. The `-Containers` parameter indicates that the container package is installed, and the `-Compute` parameter takes care of the Hyper-V package. Hyper-V is only required if using Hyper-V containers.

```none
# Set path to Windows Server 2016 Media

$WindowsMedia = "C:\TP5Media"

# Create Nano Server Image

Import-Module C:\nano\NanoServerImageGenerator.psm1
New-NanoServerImage -MediaPath $WindowsMedia -BasePath c:\nano -TargetPath c:\nano\nanocontainer.vhdx -MaxSize 10GB -Compute -Containers -DeploymentType Guest -Edition Datacenter
```
When completed, create a virtual machine from the `NanoContainer.vhdx` file. For more information on this process, see [Deploy a Windows virtual machine in Hyper-V]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_create_vm).

When the virtual machine is ready, create a remote connection with Nano Server operating system. For more information on this operation, see [Using Windows PowerShell remoting in Getting Started with Nano Server]( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt126167.aspx).

### <a name=img></a>Install OS images

An OS image is used as the base to any Windows Server or Hyper-V container. OS images have been created with both Windows Server Core and Nano Server as the underlying operating system, and can be installed using the container Provider PowerShell module. 

The following command can be used to install the Container Provider PowerShell module.

```none
Install-PackageProvider ContainerProvider -Force
```

Use `Find-ContainerImage` to return a list of images.

```none
Find-ContainerImage
```

Which will output something similar to this.

```none
Name                 Version                 Description
----                 -------                 -----------
NanoServer           10.0.10586.0            Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Techn...
WindowsServerCore    10.0.10586.0            Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Techn...

```
To download and install the Nano Server base OS image, run the following.

```none
Install-ContainerImage -Name NanoServer
```

**Note** - At this time, only the Nano Server OS Image is compatible with a Nano Server container host.

For more information on container image management see [Windows container images](../management/manage_images.md).
â€ƒ
### <a name=docker></a>Install Docker

The Docker Engine is not shipped with Windows, and not installed with the Windows container feature. To install Docker, follow the instructions in this article [Docker and Windows](./docker_windows.md).

## Hyper-V container host

### <a name=hypv></a>Enable the Hyper-V Role

Hyper-V can be enabled when creating the Nano Server virtual hard drive, see [Prepare Nano Server for containers](#nano) for these instructions.

### <a name=nest></a>Configure nested virtualization

If the container host will be virtualized, the Hyper-V virtual processor will need to be configured for nested virtualization. This includes configuring the virtual machine with at least two virtual processors and enabling the nested virtualization extension. This can be completed with the following command.

**Note** - The virtual machines must be turned off when running this command.

```none
Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VM Name> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true -Count 2
```

### <a name=dyn></a>Disable dynamic memory

If the Container Host is virtualized, dynamic memory must be disabled on the container host virtual machine. This can be configured through the settings of the virtual machine, or with the following command.

**Note** - The virtual machines must be turned off when running this command.

```none
Set-VMMemory <VM Name> -DynamicMemoryEnabled $false
``` 

### <a name=mac></a>MAC address spoofing

Finally, if the container host is virtualized, MAC spoofing must be enable. This allows each container to receive an IP Address. To enable MAC address spoofing, run the following command on the Hyper-V host. The VMName property will be the name of the container host.

```none
Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName <VM Name> | Set-VMNetworkAdapter -MacAddressSpoofing On
```
