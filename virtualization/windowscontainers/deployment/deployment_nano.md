# Container host deployment - Nano Server

**This is preliminary content and subject to change.** 

Before starting the configuration of Windows container on Nano server, you will need a system running Nano Server and also have a remote PowerShell connection with this system.

For more information on deploying and connecting with Nano Server, see [Getting Started with Nano Server]( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt126167.aspx).

An evaluation copy of Nano Server can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/nano_eula).

## 1. Install Container Feature

Install the Nano Server package management provider.

```none
Install-PackageProvider NanoServerPackage
```

After the package provide has been installed, install the container feature.

```none
Install-NanoServerPackage -Name Microsoft-NanoServer-Containers-Package
```

Optionally, if Hyper-V containers will be deployed, install the Hyper-V role. If the Nano Server container host is virtualized and Hyper-V contianers will be deployed, nested virtualization will need to be enabled. For more information on nested virtualization, see [Nested Virtualization]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/nesting).

```none
Install-NanoServerPackage Microsoft-NanoServer-Compute-Package
```

The Nano Server host will need to be re-booted after these features have been installed.

## 2. Install Docker

Docker is required in order to work with Windows containers. Docker consists of the Docker Engine, and the Docker client. Install the Docker daemon using these steps.


Download the Docker daemon and copy it to `$env:SystemRoot\system32\` of the container host. Nano Server does not currently support `Invoke-Webrequest`, this will need to be completed from a remote system

```none
# Download Docker Engine
Invoke-WebRequest https://aka.ms/tp5/b/dockerd -OutFile .\dockerd.exe
```

Install Docker as a Windows service.

```none
dockerd.exe --register-service
```

Start the Docker service.

```none
Start-Service Docker
```

## 3. Install Base Container Images

Base OS images are used as the base to any Windows Server or Hyper-V container. Base OS images are available with both Windows Server Core and Nano Server as the underlying operating system and can be installed using the container Provider PowerShell module.

The following command can be used to install the Container Image PowerShell module.

```none
Install-PackageProvider ContainerImage -Force
```

Once installed, a list of Base OS images can be returned using `Find-ContainerImage`.

```none
Find-ContainerImage

Name                           Version          Source           Summary
----                           -------          ------           -------
NanoServer                     10.0.14300.1010  ContainerImag... Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Technical...
WindowsServerCore              10.0.14300.1000  ContainerImag... Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Technical...
```

To download and install the Nano Server base OS image, run the following:

```none
Install-ContainerImage -Name NanoServer
```

**Note** - At this time, only the Nano Server OS Image is compatible with a Nano Server container host.

Restart the Docker service.

```none
Restart-Service Docker
```

For more information on container image management, see [Windows container images](../management/manage_images.md).

## 4. Work with Docker on Nano Server

### Prepare the Docker Daemon

For the best experience, manage Docker on Nano Server from a remote system. In order to do so, the following items need to be completed.

Create a firewall rule on the contianer host for the Docker connection. This will be port `2375` for an insecure connection, or port `2376` for a secure connection.

```none
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Docker daemon " dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=2376
```

Configure the Docker daemon to accept incoming connection over TCP.

First create a `daemon.json` file at `c:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json`.

```none
new-item -Type File c:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json
```

Next, copy this JSON into the file to allow the Docker daemon to accept all unsecure requests. This is not advised, but can be used for isolated testing.

```none
{
    "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "npipe://"]
}
```

The following example will configure a secure remote connection. The TLS certificates will need to be created and copied to the proper locations. For more information see, []().

```none
ADD Example
```

Restart the Docker service.

```none
Restart-Service docker
```

### Prepare the Docker Client

Download the Docker client to the remote management system.

```none
Invoke-WebRequest https://aka.ms/tp5/b/docker  -OutFile $env:SystemRoot\system32\docker.exe
```

Once completed the Docker daemon can be accessed with the `Docker -H` parameter.

```none
docker -H tcp://10.0.0.5:2375 images
```

An environmental variable DOCKER_HOST can be created that will remove the â€“H parameter requirement. The following PowerShell command can be used for this.

With this variable set, the command would now look like this.

```none
docker images
```
