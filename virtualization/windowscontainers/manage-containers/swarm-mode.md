# Getting Started with Swarm Mode 

## What is “swarm mode”?
Swarm mode is a Docker feature that provides built in container orchestration capabilities, including native clustering of Docker hosts and scheduling of container workloads. A group of Docker hosts form a “swarm” cluster when their Docker engines are running together in “swarm mode.” For additional context on swarm mode, refer to [Docker's main documentation site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

## Manager nodes and worker nodes
A swarm is composed of two types of container hosts: *manager nodes*, and *worker nodes*. Every swarm is initialized via a manager node, and all Docker CLI commands for controlling and monitoring a swarm must be executed from one of its manager nodes. Manager nodes can be thought of as “keepers” of the Swarm state—together, they form a consensus group that maintains awareness of the state of services running on the swarm, and it’s their job to ensure that the swarm’s actual state always matches its intended state, as defined by the developer or admin. 

>	Note: Any given swarm can have multiple manager nodes, but it must always have *at least one*. 

Worker nodes are orchestrated by Docker swarm via manager nodes. To join a swarm, a worker node must use a “join token” that was generated by the manager node when the swarm was initialized. Worker nodes simply receive and execute tasks from manager nodes, and so they require (and possess) no awareness of the swarm state.
