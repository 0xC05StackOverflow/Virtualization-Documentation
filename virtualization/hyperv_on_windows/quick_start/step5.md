title: Step 5: Connect to the virtual machine and finish the installation

# Step 5: Connect to the virtual machine and finish the installation #

In order to finish building your virtual machine, you need to start the VM and walk through the operating system installation.

## Connect to the VM ##
1. In **Hyper-V Manager**, right-click the virtual machine and then click **Connect**. 

2. In VMConnect, click on the green start button ![](media\vmconnect_start_button.png). This is like hitting the power button on a physical computer. 
3. The VM will boot into setup and you can walk through the installation like you would on a physical computer.
