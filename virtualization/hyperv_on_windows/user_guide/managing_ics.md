# Managing integration service
Welcome to the in-depth reference for everything integration service related.

Integration services (often called integration components) are services that allow virtual machines to communicate with the host operating system.  Some of the tasks integration services include are:
* Operating system shutdown
* Time synchronization
* Data exchange (KVP)
* Heartbeat 
* Backup (Volume Shadow Copy)
* Guest Services



Some operating systems (including different versions of Windows) have the integration services built-in, while others provide integration services through Windows Update.
