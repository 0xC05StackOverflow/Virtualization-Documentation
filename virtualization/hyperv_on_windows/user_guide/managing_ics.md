# Managing integration service
Welcome to the in-depth reference for everything integration service related.

Integration services (often called integration components) are services that allow virtual machines to communicate with the Hyper-V host.  
Some of the tasks integration services provide include:
* Operating system shutdown
* Time synchronization
* Data exchange (KVP)
* Heartbeat 
* Backup (Volume Shadow Copy)
* Guest Services

Many of these services are conviniences (such as guest services) while others can be quite important to the guest operating system's ability to fucntion correctly (time synchronization).  

Since integration services span the Hyper-V host and the guest operating systems that run on it, installing, updating, and enabling/disabling integration services can be tricky.  Integration services have also changed and adapted over time.

Some operating systems have the integration services built-in, while others provide integration services through Windows Update.
