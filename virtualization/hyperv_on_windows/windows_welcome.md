# Welcome to the Hyper-V on Windows 10 documentation


![](Windows10_rgb_Blue_S.png)



Hyper-V lets you run more than one 32-bit or 64-bit x86 operating system at the same time on the same computer. Instead of running directly on the computerâ€™s hardware, the operating systems run inside of a virtual machine (VM).

The documentation available here gives you detailed, up-to-date, information about Hyper-V on Windows.

**Note** Hyper-V in Windows is sometimes referred to as Client Hyper-V.

To learn more about virtualization with Hyper-V on Windows 10, check out this [introduction](./about/hyperv_on_windows.md).

To try out Hyper-V, follow this [walkthrough](./quick_start/walkthrough.md).


----------
**Important** 
You must license the software running on each of the guest virtual machines according to their operating system requirements.
