title: Welcome to Hyper-V on Windows 10


# Welcome to Hyper-V on Windows 10 

Hyper-V lets you run more than one 32-bit or 64-bit x86 operating system at the same time on the same computer. Instead of running directly on the computerâ€™s hardware, the operating systems run inside of a virtual machine (VM).


Hyper-V in Windows is sometimes referred to as Client Hyper-V.
