title: Hyper-V on Windows

# Welcome to the Hyper-V on Windows documentation

Hyper-V is Microsoft's virtualization technology that was first unveiled as Virtual PC then later incorperated into Windows Server and Hyper-V Server.  
In brief, Hyper-V lets you run more than one 32-bit or 64-bit x86 operating system at the same time on the same computer. Instead of working directly with the computer’s hardware, the operating systems run inside of a virtual machine (VM).

The Hyper-V role was introduced to Windows in Windows 8 as an optional feature that can be installed through Programs and Features in the Control Panel. The documentation available here gives you detailed, up-to-date, information about Hyper-V on Windows.

**Note** Hyper-V on Windows is often referred to as Client Hyper-V.

To learn more about virtualization with Hyper-V, check out this [introduction](./about/hyperv_on_windows.md).

To try out Hyper-V, follow this [walkthrough](./quick_start/walkthrough.md).

----------
**Important** 
You must license the software running on each of the guest virtual machines according to their operating system requirements.
