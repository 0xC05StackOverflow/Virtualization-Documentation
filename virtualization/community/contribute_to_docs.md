## Pull requests

Most changes will be committed via pull request.  A pull request is a way of reviewing a change set with multiple reviewers, changing, and commenting on the current content.

**What we're looking for in a pull request**  
* The change is correct -- it acctuately represents the technology
* Spelling/grammar are correct
* Logical location in the documentation
