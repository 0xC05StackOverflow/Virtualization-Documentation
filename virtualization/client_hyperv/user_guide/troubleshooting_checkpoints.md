Troubleshooting checkpoints


If you have the VM open in VMConnect, change the checkpoint type in Hyper-V manager and then create a checkpoint from VMConnect, the checkpoint taken will be whatever checkpoint type was specified when VMConnect was opened.

After applying a production checkpoint, you will need to start the VM. 

Before applying a production checkpoint, close VMConnect.
