title: Step 1: Make sure you can use your machine with Client Hyper-V

# Make sure your machine is compatible #

Client Hyper-V requires a computer with a supported 64-bit processor that has Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). 

4 GB of RAM is required, but you might need more if you want to run multiple virtual machines at the same time.

Only the Profession and Enterprise versions of Windows 10 support Client Hyper-V
