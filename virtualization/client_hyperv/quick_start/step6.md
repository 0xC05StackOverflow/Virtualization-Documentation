title: Step 6: Experiment with checkpoints

# Step 6: Experiment with checkpoints #
There are two types of checkpoints, production and standard. Standard checkpoints are the default for Hyper-V Client on Windows 10.


## Create a standard checkpoint ##
Since standard checkpoints are the default, we just need to right-click the VM and click Checkpoint.



## Create a production checkpoint ##
First we will need to change the type of checkpoint that we want to take.


## Apply the production checkpoint ##


## Apply the standard checkpoint ##


## Rename a checkpoint ##
RIght-click the last checkpoint in the tree and click Rename.
Name the checkpoint **Delete this one**.

## Delete a checkpoint ##
The previous step has probably given you a hint about what we will do next. We are going to delete the checkpoint that you just renamed.
