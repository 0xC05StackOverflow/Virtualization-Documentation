# Welcome to the Hyper-V on Windows documentation
 
Hyper-V is Microsoft's virtualization technology that was first unveiled as Virtual PC then later incorperated into Windows Server and Hyper-V Server.

The Hyper-V role was introduced to Windows in Windows 8 as an optional feature that can be installed through Programs and Features in the Control Panel. The documentation available here gives you detailed, up-to-date, information about Hyper-V on Windows.
