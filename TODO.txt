Make a weekly meeting for following up on stuff/triage md

Laundry list of a few things we need:
* Simple folder structure.
* A few basic content type templates.
* Buckets for our content:  reference, Examples, Articles, Installation, user Guide
* A name for the iroot
* A grid, OneNote, .MD file, etc., to track an overall content plan and assignments.
* Key milestones and dates, schedule?
