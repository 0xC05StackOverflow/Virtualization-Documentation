# Step 1: Make sure your machine is compatible

Only the Profession and Enterprise editions of Windows 10 support Hyper-V. 

Hyper-V requires at least 4 GB of RAM but you might need more if you want to run multiple virtual machines at the same time.

Starting in Windows 10, Hyper-V requires a 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).

## Verify compatability

To verify compatability, open PowerShell or a Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) and type: `systeminfo.exe`.  This will give you information about your computer.

All of the items under **Hyper-V Requirements** must have the value if **Yes**.

Relevant sections:
*  `OS Name` -- Must be Windows 8 or higher and either Profession or Enterprise.
*  `Hyper-V Requirements` -- all of these must be true (value of "Yes") but some can be configured in BIOS.
	*  `VM Monitor Mode Extensions` -- Property of the hardware.  Hyper-V can not run on this machine.
	*  `Virtualization Enabled in Firmware` -- Can be enabled in BIOS
	*  `Second Level Address Translation` -- Property of the hardware.  Hyper-V can not run on this machine.
	*  `Data Execution Prevention Available` -- Can be enabled in BIOS
	
If Hyper-V is already enabled, the Hyper-V Requirements section will read:  
```
Hyper-V Requirements: A hypervisor has been detected. Features required for Hyper-V will not be displayed.
```
