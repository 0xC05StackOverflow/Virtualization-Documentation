Welcome to our Windows Container documentation experiment!

Right now, you're probably wondering where to put your content.

Folder Structure:
** pages        most markdown files live here!  This is where all published pages with content related to containers will live.
** media        refrenced images, videos, and other embedded media.
** codeSnippits sample code, scripts, etc.
**        DO NOT TOUCH THIS!  This is where shared headers and decoration goes for generating the documentation in HTML.
** sandbox      use this as your sandbox for previewing content, seeing how git works, storing half baked ideas, making folders, whatever you want to do.


Helpful guides for getting started:
overview.md     The content that should be here eventually

Living Documents:
QA              Is something unclear?  I'm documenting questions and answers here.  I'll update all of the READMEs when appropriate.
TODO            This is the documentation TODO.  If you want to know what we're working on, this is the scratch pad.
