title: Windows Server Containers

# Windows Server Containers #

Windows Server containers provide applications an isolated, portable and resource controlled operating environment. This isolation enables containerized applications to run without risk of dependencies and environmental configuration affecting the application. By sharing the same kernel and other key system components, containers exhibit rapid startup times and reduced resource overhead. Rapid startup helps in development and testing scenarios and continuous integration environments, while the reduced resource overhead makes them ideal for service-oriented architectures.

The Windows Server container infrastructure allows for sharing, publishing and shipping of containers to anywhere the next wave of Windows Server is running. With this new technology millions of Windows developers familiar with technologies such as .NET, ASP.NET, PowerShell, and more will be able to leverage container technology. No longer will developers have to choose between the advantages of containers and using Windows Server technologies.

## Next Steps

- Take a deeper look at containers and the [container life cycle](ContainerLifeCycle.md "Windows Containers Life Cycle"). 
- Containers and virtual machines both provide flexible ways to run workloads in an isolated fashion. [When should I use a container and when should I use a virtual machine? Containers_vs_VMs.md](Containers_vs_VMs.md "When should I use a container and when should I use a virtual machine? ")
- [Learn about how containers compare to App-V](ContainersvsAppV.md). When should I use one, when should I use the other?
