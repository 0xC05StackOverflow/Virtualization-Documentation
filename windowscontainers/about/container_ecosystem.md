Windows containers are a small component in a bigger picture for developers and system administrators.
Besides isolation, most users will need some way to manage containers, share containers, develop apps that may run in containers, or even orchastrate resource division across many containers.

Containers make it easy for developers to produce applications which evolve rapidly and organically by providing equally agile application packaging and isolation.
