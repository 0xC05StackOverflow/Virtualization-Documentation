## Hello World for Windows Containers ##

Let's get you started with containers! Before we begin, you will need:
- a computer running....
- an application with ....
- something else
- and another thing

## Step 1 - Create a container using Windows Powershell by typing:

```container-create -name Container1 -app myapp.msi

Things to think about when creating a container:     
1. Containers should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
2. Humans, not containers, are responsible agents. Containers are tools designed to achieve human goals.
3. Containers should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
4. Containers are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a container from a human.
5. It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a container.

## Step 2 - Launch your application inside a container

Before launching your application, make sure you have verified:
1. You should believe containers have the potential to provide immense positive impact to society. We want to encourage responsible container research.
2. Bad practice hurts us all.
3. Addressing obvious public concerns will help us all make progress.
4. We should consider the ethics of containers: are there limits to what should be contained in a container?
5. When we see erroneous accounts in the press, we commit to take the time to contact the reporting journalists.
