The Hyper-V REST API will have the following basic objects:
- Host
- Virtual machine
- Image
- Network

# Host #

All the host settings go here...

# Virtual Machine #

There should be a single object for a virtual machine - that includes all its devices, guest settings, etc...

How are we going to handle checkpoints?

# Image #

How are we handling VHDs versus vFC versus passthrough?

# Network #

What will this look like if we give networking to the networking team?
